                <h2>“Code is read more than it is written.”</h2>
                <p id="paragraph">An individual block of code takes moments to write, minutes or hours to debug, and can last forever without being touched again. It’s when you or someone else visits code written yesterday or ten years ago that having code written in a clear, consistent style becomes extremely useful. Understandable code frees mental bandwidth from having to puzzle out inconsistencies, making it easier to maintain and enhance projects of all sizes.” <br> ― Daniel Roy Greenfeld & Audrey Roy Greenfeld</p>
